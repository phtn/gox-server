## Scalable Go Project Folder Structure

> In Go, a scalable and well-structured folder setup is essential for managing larger projects. As the project grows, you may want to split logic into different files and packages. Here's a commonly used folder structure that is modular and follows Go best practices, designed to handle future scalability.

```zsh

my-go-project/
├── api/ # API-related logic
│ ├── handler.go # HTTP handlers (endpoints)
│ └── middleware.go # Middleware functions (e.g., auth, logging)
│
├── cmd/ # Main applications of the project
│ └── my-go-project/
│ └── main.go # Entry point of the application
│
├── config/ # Configuration files and logic
│ └── config.go # Configuration loading logic (e.g., from env variables)
│
├── internal/ # Internal application packages (not for external use)
│ ├── service/ # Core business logic
│ │ └── service.go # Service-related functions
│ │
│ ├── models/ # Data models (structs)
│ │ └── user.go # Example model: User struct
│ │
│ └── repository/ # Database layer
│ └── user_repo.go # Repository for User (DB interactions)
│
├── pkg/ # Public packages (can be imported by other projects)
│ └── utils/ # Utility functions
│ └── string_utils.go # Utility functions for string manipulation
│
├── vendor/ # (optional) Dependency management
│ # Includes third-party packages (used with go mod vendor)
│
├── go.mod # Go module file (dependency tracking)
├── go.sum # Dependency versions checksum file
├── Makefile # Commands to automate tasks (e.g., build, run, test)
└── README.md # Documentation for the project
```

### Explanation of Each Directory and File:

1. api/
   This directory contains all the code related to HTTP endpoints:

handler.go: Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests (like controllers in MVC).
middleware.go: Middleware functions such as authentication, logging, etc. 2. cmd/
This is the entry point for your applications. For example, if your project has multiple binaries, you can put them under separate directories in cmd/. Each directory under cmd/ contains its own main.go file.

cmd/my-go-project/main.go: The main Go file for the my-go-project app. 3. config/
This folder stores configurations (loading config from environment variables, files, or flags). You can also create config structs here.

config.go: Loads configurations like API keys, database connections, etc. 4. internal/
This is for the core logic of the application and is inaccessible to external projects (because of the Go convention). It's used for your service layer, models, and repositories:

service/: Contains the business logic (application logic).
models/: Contains your data models (for example, structs representing database entities).
user.go: Could define the User struct.
repository/: Data access layer, which communicates with the database (commonly called DAOs in other languages). 5. pkg/
This folder is for packages that you might want to make available for external use. These packages are meant to be imported by other projects.

utils/: Utility or helper functions that can be reused across different packages.
string_utils.go: Utility functions for working with strings (e.g., converting to camelCase, snake_case). 6. vendor/
This is optional. If you run go mod vendor, this directory will hold all your external dependencies locally. Useful for ensuring reproducibility in builds, especially in CI/CD pipelines or air-gapped environments.

7. go.mod and go.sum
   go.mod: The module definition file where Go modules and dependencies are defined.
   go.sum: Auto-generated file containing checksums of the module dependencies.
8. Makefile
   A Makefile is used for automating commands (e.g., make build, make run, make test). It helps you define shortcuts for compiling, running tests, or other repeated tasks.

9. README.md
   Provides a summary of the project, how to set it up, and how to use it.

### Example Breakdown of main.go in cmd/my-go-project/:

```go

package main

import (
 "fmt"
 "log"
 "net/http"
 "my-go-project/api"
 "my-go-project/config"
)

func main() {
 // Load configuration
 conf := config.LoadConfig()

 // Start the server
 http.HandleFunc("/", api.HomeHandler)
 log.Printf("Server started on %s", conf.ServerAddress)
 err := http.ListenAndServe(conf.ServerAddress, nil)
 if err != nil {
     log.Fatal("Server failed:", err)
 }
}
```

How to Scale the Project
As the project grows, you can add more packages in the internal/ or pkg/ directories for additional functionality (like new services, models, or repositories).
You can create sub-packages (e.g., internal/service/user or pkg/auth) to better separate logic and keep files manageable.
The folder structure ensures that the project is modular, which is crucial for testability and maintainability.
Let me know if you'd like help setting up any specific part of this structure!

The Go `vendor` directory is a special folder used for dependency management. When you use `go mod vendor`, it copies all your project's dependencies (external packages) into this `vendor/` directory. This allows your project to use these dependencies locally, without having to download them from the internet during builds or deployments.

### Purpose of the `vendor/` Directory

1. **Local Dependencies**:
   The `vendor/` directory holds a local copy of the third-party libraries your project relies on. This can be useful in environments where you need all dependencies bundled (e.g., for CI/CD pipelines, air-gapped environments, or ensuring that your project builds even if a dependency is removed from the internet).

2. **Reproducibility**:
   It ensures that your builds are reproducible. Even if a package version changes or is no longer available, the version stored in `vendor/` will remain the same and will be used.

3. **Offline Builds**:
   If your project is in a restricted or offline environment, having the `vendor/` directory ensures that you can build the project without an internet connection.

### How to Use `vendor/` in a Go Project

1. **Enable Go Modules**:
   First, ensure that your project is using Go modules. If you haven't already done so, initialize your project with:

   ```bash
   go mod init my-go-project
   ```

2. **Vendor Dependencies**:
   To copy your project’s dependencies into the `vendor/` directory, run:

   ```bash
   go mod vendor
   ```

   This command will:

   - Download all the required dependencies for your project.
   - Place them inside a `vendor/` folder at the root of your project.

3. **Build with Vendor**:
   After creating the `vendor/` directory, Go will automatically prioritize using the packages in `vendor/` during builds, instead of fetching them from the internet.
   You can force Go to use only the vendor directory (without checking for dependencies online) by running:

   ```bash
   go build -mod=vendor
   ```

4. **Structure of the `vendor/` Directory**:
   Once the `vendor` command is run, the structure looks like this:

   ```
   my-go-project/
   ├── vendor/                  # Contains all dependencies
   │   └── github.com/
   │       └── gorilla/
   │           └── mux/
   │               └── mux.go   # Example of an external dependency
   ├── go.mod                   # Module definition
   ├── go.sum                   # Checksums of dependencies
   └── main.go                  # Your main application
   ```

5. **Version Control**:
   It's common to **not** commit the `vendor/` folder to version control (like Git), but some projects choose to include it. It depends on whether your team prefers to bundle dependencies in the repository.

6. **Remove Vendor**:
   If you want to go back to fetching dependencies over the internet (and delete the `vendor/` folder), you can simply delete the folder and Go will revert to fetching dependencies from their sources.

### Pros of Using the `vendor` Directory

- **Reliability**: Builds do not rely on external servers or network connectivity, ensuring that your code always works even if a package is removed or changed upstream.
- **Faster Builds**: Since the dependencies are local, there's no need to fetch them from the internet every time you build.

### Cons of Using the `vendor` Directory

- **Increased Repository Size**: If you commit the `vendor/` directory, your project size will increase since you're including all dependencies in your repo.
- **Maintenance**: You must periodically update the `vendor/` directory if the dependencies change or are updated.

### Alternatives

Since Go modules became the standard (as of Go 1.11+), the need for the `vendor` directory has diminished somewhat. Now, Go modules handle dependency versioning in a clean way using `go.mod` and `go.sum`, without needing to bundle dependencies inside the project directory. However, for environments where dependency reproducibility is a must, the `vendor/` directory remains useful.

In summary, `vendor` is a way to ensure that your project can build consistently with all its dependencies locally bundled. It’s particularly useful for reproducibility, offline builds, and certain deployment environments.

Great! Now that you’ve created the `gox` project folder, let’s set it up with a scalable structure. Here’s how you can proceed:

### Step 1: Initialize the Go Module

Navigate into the `gox` folder and initialize the Go module for your project:

```bash
cd gox
go mod init gox
```

This will create a `go.mod` file, which Go will use to manage your project’s dependencies.

### Step 2: Set Up the Folder Structure

Let's create a scalable folder structure inside `gox`. You can do this by running the following commands to create the directories:

```bash
mkdir -p api cmd/gox config internal/{service,models,repository} pkg/utils
touch cmd/gox/main.go config/config.go internal/service/service.go internal/models/user.go internal/repository/user_repo.go
```

This will create the following structure:

```
gox/
├── api/                   # API-related logic
├── cmd/
│   └── gox/
│       └── main.go         # Entry point of the application
├── config/
│   └── config.go           # Configuration logic
├── internal/
│   ├── service/
│   │   └── service.go      # Business logic
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── user.go         # Data models
│   └── repository/
│       └── user_repo.go    # Repository for database interactions
└── pkg/
    └── utils/
```

### Step 3: Populate `main.go` (Entry Point)

Let’s start by writing a simple `main.go` to get things running. Open `cmd/gox/main.go` and add the following code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "gox/api"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", api.HomeHandler)
    fmt.Println("Server is running on port 8080...")
    err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Failed to start server:", err)
    }
}
```

This code sets up a basic HTTP server and references a handler we’ll define next.

### Step 4: Create an API Handler

In `api/`, create a file called `handler.go` with the following simple handler:

```go
package api

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func HomeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Welcome to gox!")
}
```

### Step 5: Configuration File (`config/config.go`)

Let’s add a basic configuration loader. In `config/config.go`, add:

```go
package config

import (
    "os"
)

type Config struct {
    ServerAddress string
}

func LoadConfig() Config {
    serverAddress := os.Getenv("SERVER_ADDRESS")
    if serverAddress == "" {
        serverAddress = ":8080" // Default port
    }
    return Config{ServerAddress: serverAddress}
}
```

This file loads the server address from an environment variable, with a default of `:8080` if not set.

### Step 6: Run the Project

Now you can run the project from the `gox` folder:

```bash
go run cmd/gox/main.go
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser, and you should see `Welcome to gox!`.

### Next Steps:

1. **Business Logic (`service`)**: Add your application’s core logic inside `internal/service/service.go`.
2. **Models (`models`)**: Define your data models inside `internal/models/user.go`.
3. **Repository (`repository`)**: Add database interactions inside `internal/repository/user_repo.go`.
4. **Utils (`pkg/utils`)**: Add reusable utility functions inside `pkg/utils`.
